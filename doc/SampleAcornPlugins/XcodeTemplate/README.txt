If you don't have the folder:
~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Project Templates/Bundle/ (for 10.4)
or:
/Developer/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Bundle/ (for 10.5)

Make one.  Drag and drop the whole "Acorn Plugin" folder in there.  "Acorn Plugin" should now show up in the New Project window in Xcode undler the Bundle section.
